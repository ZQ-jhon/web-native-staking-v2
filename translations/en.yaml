reclaimBucket.introduction: This tool allows you to reclaim a bucket that is owned by a private key/account in hardware wallet. How it works is that you sign a message using the private key to prove your ownership of the bucket and indicate a new address, and upon verification, the bucket will be transferred to the new address on IoTeX blockchain. You can also reclaim a bucket using our ioctl tool, run 'ioctl stake2 reclaim' and follow the instructions.
