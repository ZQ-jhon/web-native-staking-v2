  "title": "IoTeX DOTM (Delegate of the Month) - July 2019",
  "description": "<p>Over the past 3+ months of Mainnet, we have continuously enhanced the IoTeX Delegates Program. One of our main goals is to better connect the IoTeX community and Delegates — this involves providing more transparency regarding Delegate contributions, achievements, and commitments. We are excited to introduce the Delegate Badges Program as our next initiative!</p>  <p>To make Delegate activities more transparent for IoTeX voters, we will publicly display Delegate Badges on the <a href=\"http://member.iotex.io\">member.iotex.io</a> website starting in August. But first, we need the IoTeX Community's help to VOTE!</p>  <p>Delegate of the Month Badge: every month, IoTeX community will elect 5 “Delegates of the Month (DOTM)”. Each DOTM gets 5 million votes from IoTeX Foundation, prime top placement on <a href=\"http://member.iotex.io\">member.iotex.io</a>, and a permanent DOTM badge!</p>  <p>Before voting, review the DOTM candidates' contributions here: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@iotex/voting-for-july-dotm-via-smart-contract-is-live-vote-now-bf92de9ccb31\">https://medium.com/@iotex/voting-for-july-dotm-via-smart-contract-is-live-vote-now-bf92de9ccb31</a></p>  <p>Official Rules:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Any Delegate may submit an application to be on the DOTM ballot</p></li>  <li><p>All IoTeX Voters are eligible to vote for DOTM at <a href=\"http://member.iotex.io/polls\">member.iotex.io/polls</a></p></li>  <li><p>Each IoTeX Wallet can vote for 3 DOTM candidates. DOTM voting is not stake-weighted (1 Wallet = 3 votes for 3 different candidates)</p></li>  <li><p>Any signs of voting manipulation by Delegates will result in permanent ban from the DOTM program!</p></li> </ul>  <p>Check detailed voting rules here: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@iotex/iotex-delegate-of-the-month-dotm-july-2019-re-vote-ad220f3fdb07\">https://medium.com/@iotex/iotex-delegate-of-the-month-dotm-july-2019-re-vote-ad220f3fdb07</a></p>",
